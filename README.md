Hi All,

Kindly, find the attached jupyter notebooks which I had practice during the preparation of the Qiksit Certification https://www.ibm.com/training/certification/C0010300.

I have used the reference of the objectives given in the above link  and prepare the jupyter notebooks for each section to understand the concept much better.

There are quite number of jupyter notebooks . Not to get scared. I have tried to prepare from basic , simple examples to understand the concept. Kindly, let me know if any modification is required.

In each jupyter notebook I have included the references of the syntax with other resources. 
Following resources were quite helpful for me during the preparation:
